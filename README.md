### 
- **Country and Job Type Slicers:**
This section allows anyone to filter through a specific job type or country to further narrow down data on jobs.

<img width="646" height="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adcf2163-39a3-4991-875b-48d006fb0589" />

- **Country and Job Count Bubble Map:**
This map allows the user to easily see where a specific job type is and identify the associated number of jobs for a specific region.

<img width="554" height="340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ffc2f3a-784b-44a5-8c0e-9a00b931698c" />

- **Job Count, Median Yearly and Hourly Salary Cards**
These cards allow easy snapshot data into what the job count is and salary associated for a specific country, skill, or company filter.

<img width="1920" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/829855f6-92ab-44c7-bed4-09deb5665ef5" />

- **Job Count and Skill Type**
This section provides information on what skills are learned along with the job count. There are two slicers at the bottom specific for this bar chart which allows the user to filter between the job count and job percent for a certain skill.

<img width="485" height="558" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae8f08a3-b4e2-4243-8af6-70436aec97b5" />

- **Average Salary from Skills**
This section is like the previous one but considers the salary associated with any skills. The slicers at the bottom of this chart help differentiate the hourly and yearly salary for a specific skill type.
<img width="479" height="554" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eb310a4-1523-4b84-90bf-96b03a0296cc" />

- **Median Yearly Salary by Company**
This chart allows the user to quickly see which companies offer the most earning potential. It is important to note that some companies only have either 3 or fewer postings, which does not accurately represent the true median salary for a company.

<img width="470" height="556" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/257aad26-af2e-400d-981b-f1a28affa6d8" />

- **Job Count per Company**
Now this chart would pair perfectly with the previous chart because it would allow a visual on a company with a lot of job openings and accurately display the median income for that company.  

<img width="487" height="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40087d52-4f67-4a1c-9582-29da95985681" />

## Conclusion

#### Using With Other Programs
-  I can see how valuable this is when paired with other programs such as SQL or Python to extract the raw data and then visualize and adapt the data in Power BI. It not only leads to important decisions from stakeholders but allows anyone to interpret large amounts of data that looks intimidating at first that you may see with millions of rows in an excel file. Combining both these tools with AI can dramatically improve clarity and decrease decision making time in businesses and in real life applications 

#### Final Thoughts:
- Using Power BI, I was able to understand how this tool can be used in various applications that allows for easy snapshot of complex data. Being creative is a must when using this tool to properly organize and tell a story about a certain data set. There are many more applications to be used and to showcase in various fields such as healthcare, energy, retail, and many more but I believe that using this tool as a foundation for storytelling is imperative for proper understanding of complex data.
